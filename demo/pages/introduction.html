        With the introduction of the Web Audio API and music frameworks such as Flocking,
        it's possible to make music and develop custom instruments entirely using Web technologies.
        <br/>
        A variety of user interface component libraries have been developed to assist in the creation
        of musical interfaces. However, the majority of them aren't very "web-like." Many are based
        on Canvas or bitmap images, and aren't compatible with responsive design techniques, can't be
        easily re-styled or customized using tools like CSS, and aren't accessible via the keyboard or
        with assistive technologies such as a screenreader.
        <br/>
        This project will involve the creation of a small collection of high-quality, responsive,
        SVG or DOM-based musical user interface controls such as knobs, sliders, x/y pads, button matrices,
        envelope editors, waveform viewers
